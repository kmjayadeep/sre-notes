# Monitoring and instrumentation

Ways to monitor
* traces -> to see how control flows in a distributed system
* logs -> for debugging, analysis
* metrics -> to track performance, health status, latency etc
  * latency
  * traffic
  * errors
  * saturation -> how much more it can handle before it breaks down

  alerting -> notify relevent teams/people when things go wrong (or
  about to go wrong)
  and take some action to rectify that automatically or manually

  one of the responsibilities of an SRE include responding to alerts and
  making sure that it won't happen again
